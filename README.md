# HCAD_TAZ_METRO
Harris County Appraisal District Parcels within Houston Metro Service Area

Collecting and analyzing random samples of parcels to determine at any given selection: 

Data about the parcel itself
- Parcel Count Share between City of Houston vs other municipalities (incl unincorporated)
- spread of state class, land use code and building type

Data about physical access to transit
- Distance to the nearest Transit Center
- Distance to the nearest commuter park and ride 
- Distance to the nearest LRT station

Data about physical barriers to transit 
- bridges within 1 mile radius
- railroad crossings within 1 mile radius
- freeway within 1 mile radius

## Step 1: Extracting Randomized Sample of Parcel Geometries within METRO Service Area

## Step 2: Extracting Collected Account Numbers and its Real Property Data

## Step 3: Calculating Overlay Analysis 

## Step 4: Run a random forest model to determine the current random "snapshot" generalization of the METRO Service Area
